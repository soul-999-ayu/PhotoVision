<p><strong>Versatile entry-level operating microscope ideal for out-patient procedures</strong></p>



<p>With its full range of basic functions, the OM-6 Operating Microscope provides standard level brightness and clarity of view. This simple, high- performance microscope combines outstanding operability and safety, and is optimised for ease of use in a variety of out-patient procedures, including on the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, and tear ducts. Thanks to its high-quality optical system it can also be used for cataract surgery, depending on the hospital/clinic environment.</p>



<p>Using an LED light source with an operating life of approximately 40,000 hours reduces the need for bulb changes and keeps power consumption low, ensuring a high degree of cost performance.</p>



<p>LED operating life is defined as a state when light intensity drops to 70%. The operating life of the LED used in OM-6 is approximately 40,000 hours, although this is not guaranteed.</p>

<p><strong>Compact operating microscope with outstanding optical performance and functionality</strong></p>



<p>The OM-9 is a high-performance operating microscope that offers a wide range of advanced functions all contained within a compact package. Using an illumination system and apochromatic lens that ensure the highest level of optical performance, this microscope provides users with a contrast-rich view that is bright and has a 3D appearance.</p>



<p>A new red reflex illumination mechanism capable of capturing outstanding red reflex images and high-intensity LED are combined to achieve a clear and wide field of view and excellent colour reproduction.</p>

<p><strong>Ultimate high-performance operating microscope ideal for cataract surgery</strong></p>



<p>The OM-19 is a high-performance operating microscope designed to meet the quality conditions required for cataract surgery and to cover all other necessary functions. TAKAGI has successfully developed the world’s first operating microscope on which light intensity for red reflex and main illumination can be independently adjusted in response to each particular case and surgeon’s preference. With a broad line-up of options, including a wide-angle fundus observation adapter, with a fundus observation device attached the OM-19 can also be used for retina and vitreous surgery.</p>
